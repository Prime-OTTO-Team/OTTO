                        We, and our third-party partners, automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our
                        Service, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us.  We typically collect this information through a variety of

                        technologies, file information, and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”).  For example, we
                        collect information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system,
                        language, location of your wireless device (e.g., latitude and longitude), the state or country from which you
                        accessed the Service, the date and time of your visit, error logs, and other such information.

                        from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Service.  When you access our Service from a mobile
                        device, we may collect unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application
                        (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers (“IDFA”), Google AdID, or Windows Advertising ID),

                        we may be able to approximate a device’s location by analyzing other information, like an IP address.  We may
                        collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics to help us measure traffic and
                        usage trends for the Service and to understand more about the demographics of our users.  You can learn more

                        information about each device you use when you are logged in to our Service.  We may also work
                        with third-party partners who employ tracking technologies or the application of statistical modeling
                        tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household.  We may share a
                        common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) with third-party advertising partners
                        to help recognize you across devices.  We, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to
                        serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices, to\
                        perform analytics, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.
