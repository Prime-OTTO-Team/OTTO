                            A membership allows you and your Authorized User(s) (if any) to access the Services. Memberships may be free or
                            paid depending on your relationship with us. Paid memberships allow you to access additional or different features
                            and functionalities, while free memberships provide limited access to the Services. A membership may be procured
                            through the Services interface, or in some cases, via an order form entered into between you and us (each an “<b><i>Order
                            Form</i></b>”). Paid memberships commence when we make them available to you. Paid memberships continue for the
                            term specified in the Services or in the Order Form, as applicable (which term may be variable if the Order Form
                            provides for one-time or other limited-time use), and free memberships continue until terminated (in each case, the

                            Certain aspects of our Services are available only through paid memberships that automatically renew.
                            MEMBERSHIP RENEWAL FEES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED TO YOUR DESIGNATED PAYMENT
                            METHOD AT THE FEE RATE AND BILLING CYCLE ON YOUR ORDER FORM, UNTIL YOU CANCEL. Unless
                            ]otherwise set forth in an Order Form, (a) all memberships automatically renew for additional periods equal to one (1)
                            year; and (b) the per-unit pricing during any automatic renewal Membership Period will be the then-current price
                            communicated to you by us. Either party can give the other notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) days before the
                            end of a Membership Period to stop a membership from automatically renewing. Cancellations will apply on a going-
                            forward basis, and you will not be entitled to any refund. You understand that you must cancel your membership at
                            least sixty (60) days before the Initial Membership Period or then-current Renewal Membership Period, to avoid
                            automatic renewal. You may cancel your membership by using our online cancellation mechanism or sending an
                            email to contracts@OTTO.com with the subject line “MEMBERSHIP CANCELLATION” and that cancellation will go
                            into effect in at the completion of the Initial Membership Period or the then-current Renewal Membership Period.
                            Prices are subject to change. Paid membership for OTTO Market Intelligence only can be cancelled at any time and
                            you will continue to have access to OTTO Market Intelligence through the end of your monthly billing period.
