                            A membership allows you and your Authorized User(s) (if any) to access the Services. Memberships may be free or
                            paid depending on your relationship with us. Paid memberships allow you to access additional or different features
                            and functionalities, while free memberships provide limited access to the Services. A membership may be procured
                            through the Services interface, or in some cases, via an order form entered into between you and us (each an “<b><i>Order
                            Form</i></b>”). Paid memberships commence when we make them available to you. Paid memberships continue for the
                            term specified in the Services or in the Order Form, as applicable (which term may be variable if the Order Form
                            provides for one-time or other limited-time use), and free memberships continue until terminated (in each case, the

                            Certain aspects of our Services are available only through paid memberships that automatically renew.
                            MEMBERSHIP RENEWAL FEES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED TO YOUR DESIGNATED PAYMENT
                            METHOD AT THE FEE RATE AND BILLING CYCLE ON YOUR ORDER FORM, UNTIL YOU CANCEL. Unless
                            ]otherwise set forth in an Order Form, (a) all memberships automatically renew for additional periods equal to one (1)
                            year; and (b) the per-unit pricing during any automatic renewal Membership Period will be the then-current price
                            communicated to you by us. Either party can give the other notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) days before the
                            end of a Membership Period to stop a membership from automatically renewing. Cancellations will apply on a going-
                            forward basis, and you will not be entitled to any refund. You understand that you must cancel your membership at
                            least sixty (60) days before the Initial Membership Period or then-current Renewal Membership Period, to avoid
                            automatic renewal. You may cancel your membership by using our online cancellation mechanism or sending an
                            email to contracts@OTTO.com with the subject line “MEMBERSHIP CANCELLATION” and that cancellation will go
                            into effect in at the completion of the Initial Membership Period or the then-current Renewal Membership Period.
                            Prices are subject to change. Paid membership for OTTO Market Intelligence only can be cancelled at any time and
                            you will continue to have access to OTTO Market Intelligence through the end of your monthly billing period.

                            <b><i>Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in
                            which you may seek relief from us. </i></b>For any dispute with us, you agree to first contact us at info@OTTO.com and
                            attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If we have not been able to resolve a dispute within sixty (60) days of your
                            ]first contact, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other
                            equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to the Agreement, or the breach or
                            alleged breach thereof by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in
                            effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles County, California,
                            unless we agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for
                            paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by
                            the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other
                            witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay
                            a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the
                            award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your
                            reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent
                            jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the
                            informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
                            court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing us from seeking injunctive or
                            other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation,
                            or violation of our data security, intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights.

                            acknowledges and agree that the Agreement is solely between Customer and us, not Apple, Inc. (“<b><i>Apple</i></b>”) and that
                            Apple has no responsibility for the Apple-Sourced Software or content thereof. Customer’s use of the Apple-Sourced
                            Software must comply with the App Store Terms of Service. Customer acknowledges that Apple has no obligation
                            whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Apple-Sourced Software. In the

                            including, but not limited to: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the Apple-Sourced Software fails to conform

                            possession and use of that Apple-Sourced Software infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, we, and not
