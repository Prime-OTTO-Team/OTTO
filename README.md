# OTTO

## Description

_Duration: 2.5 Week Sprint_

Otto is an app to help faciliate off market, owner to owner commercial real estate transactions. Placing commercial real estate on the open market can often alert tenants and give them more negotiating power. It also begins a count up on days listed on the market and the higher the number of days gets, the worse it looks. These are some reasons why sellers might prefer selling off market. But unfortunately it is hard for brokerage firms to list off market properties on a website without opportunites getting poached. Otto provides that solution by listing properties on the site but limiting the data for the public to see

### Prerequisites

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `otto_database`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using [Postico]() to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
